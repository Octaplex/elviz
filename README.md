Elviz is a set of utilities for visualizing electromagnetic phenomena. Thank
you — thank you very much — for checking it out.

# Installation

Elviz depends only on VPython (hurray!), so installation is quick and easy.
VPython provides downloads for
[windows](http://vpython.org/contents/download_windows.html),
[mac](http://vpython.org/contents/download_windows.html), and
[linux](http://vpython.org/contents/download_linux.html).
